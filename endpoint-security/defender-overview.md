# Endpoint Security and Microsoft Defender

## Overview
This document outlines an endpoint security approach within a Microsoft 365 environment using Microsoft Defender. Endpoints represent a significant attack surface, and effective protection is essential for preventing malware, credential theft and system compromise.

---

## Why Endpoint Security Is Important
User devices are commonly targeted through phishing, malicious downloads and vulnerable software. Once compromised, endpoints can be used to access cloud services, steal credentials or spread malware.

Effective endpoint security helps to:
- Prevent malware and ransomware infections
- Detect suspicious or malicious activity
- Protect organisational data on user devices
- Support secure and reliable service delivery

## Endpoint Security Principles Applied

### 1. Built-In Malware Protection
- Microsoft Defender is enabled as the primary anti-malware solution.
- Real-time protection and regular definition updates are enforced.
- Tamper protection is enabled where supported.

---

### 2. Device Update and Patch Awareness
- Operating system updates are enabled to ensure security patches are applied.
- Unsupported or outdated devices are identified and addressed.
- Patch management supports both security and stability requirements.

---

### 3. Integration with Identity and Access Controls
- Endpoint security is considered alongside identity controls such as MFA and Conditional Access.
- Access to services can be restricted based on device health or compliance status.

---

## Monitoring and Response
- Alerts and endpoint status are monitored to identify potential security issues.
- Suspected incidents are investigated and handled through established support processes.
- Documentation supports consistent response and escalation where required.

---

## Alignment with Cyber Essentials
This endpoint security approach supports Cyber Essentials by:
- Providing effective malware protection
- Supporting secure system configuration
- Reducing the risk of compromised user devices

## Notes
This overview is based on lab environments and Microsoft-recommended best practices. No production device data or alert information is included.
