# Anti-Phishing Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines a structured anti-phishing approach within Microsoft 365 to protect users from phishing, impersonation and social engineering attacks. Email remains one of the most common entry points for cyber incidents, making preventative controls essential for organisational security.

---

## Why Anti-Phishing Controls Are Important
Phishing attacks often target users directly, exploiting trust and urgency to steal credentials or deliver malicious content. Without appropriate controls, a single compromised account can lead to wider system access, data loss or financial fraud.

Anti-phishing controls help to:
- Prevent credential harvesting attacks
- Detect impersonation attempts
- Reduce the likelihood of malware delivery
- Protect users and organisational data

## Anti-Phishing Control Strategy

### 1. Impersonation Protection
- Protection is enabled against user and domain impersonation.
- High-risk users such as administrators and senior staff are prioritised.
- Display name spoofing and lookalike domain attacks are monitored and blocked.

---

### 2. Phishing Detection and Filtering
- Advanced phishing detection is enabled to identify suspicious email content.
- Emails identified as phishing are quarantined or clearly flagged.
- Links and attachments are analysed where supported by licensing.

---

### 3. User Awareness and Reporting
- Users are encouraged to report suspicious emails.
- Reporting mechanisms are clearly documented to support early detection.
- Feedback loops help improve filtering accuracy over time.

---

## Policy Management and Review
- Anti-phishing policies are documented and reviewed regularly.
- Changes follow controlled processes to avoid unintended disruption.
- Effectiveness is assessed through monitoring and user feedback.

---

## Alignment with Cyber Essentials
This anti-phishing approach supports Cyber Essentials by:
- Reducing malware and credential theft risk
- Supporting secure system configuration
- Protecting users from common attack methods

## Notes
All configurations described are based on lab environments and Microsoft-recommended best practices. No production data or sensitive information is included.
