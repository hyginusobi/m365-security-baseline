# Evidence and Documentation Approach

## Purpose of This Folder
This folder describes the type of evidence that would typically be collected to support security configuration, audit and compliance activities within a Microsoft 365 environment.

It is intentionally documentation-focused to avoid the inclusion of sensitive information, credentials or production system data.

## Types of Evidence Typically Collected

Evidence used to support security assurance and audit activities may include:

- Configuration screenshots with sensitive details redacted
- Policy summaries and configuration exports
- Administrative role assignment records
- Conditional Access policy definitions
- Audit log confirmation and activity summaries
- Change records and approval documentation

## Evidence Handling Principles

To ensure security and compliance, the following principles are applied:

- No production credentials, tenant identifiers or personal data are stored
- Screenshots are redacted where necessary
- Evidence is collected only for defined purposes
- Access to evidence is restricted to authorised individuals
- Evidence is retained in line with organisational policy

---

## Use in Audits and Reviews

This evidence approach supports:
- Cyber Essentials assessments
- Internal security reviews
- Incident investigations
- Governance and compliance audits

Clear documentation and controlled evidence handling help demonstrate accountability, traceability and secure system management.
