# Audit Logging and Monitoring

## Overview
This document outlines the role of audit logging within a Microsoft 365 environment. Audit logs provide visibility into user and administrative activity, supporting security monitoring, incident investigation and compliance requirements.

## Why Audit Logging Is Important
Audit logging enables organisations to understand what actions have taken place within their systems. In the event of an incident or operational issue, audit logs provide critical evidence to support investigation and remediation.

Audit logging helps to:
- Track administrative and user activity
- Support incident response and troubleshooting
- Improve accountability and governance
- Demonstrate compliance during audits

## Audit Logging Principles Applied

### 1. Unified Audit Logging
- Unified audit logging is enabled to capture activity across Microsoft 365 services.
- Events such as user sign-ins, administrative changes and data access are recorded.

---

### 2. Administrative Activity Monitoring
- Administrative actions are logged to support accountability and traceability.
- Logs can be reviewed to validate changes and investigate unexpected behaviour.

---

### 3. Operational Use of Logs
- Audit logs are used to support troubleshooting and incident investigation.
- Relevant log data is reviewed during security incidents or service disruptions.
- Findings are documented to support learning and service improvement.

---

## Review and Governance
- Audit logging configuration is reviewed periodically to ensure coverage remains appropriate.
- Access to logs is restricted to authorised personnel.
- Log data is handled in accordance with data protection and retention requirements.
