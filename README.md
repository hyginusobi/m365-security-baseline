# Microsoft 365 Security Baseline

This repository documents a practical Microsoft 365 security baseline aligned with Cyber Essentials and enterprise best practices. It demonstrates a structured, security-aware approach to identity, email, endpoint and audit configuration within a Microsoft 365 environment.

The purpose of this project is to provide clear technical evidence of how Microsoft 365 can be secured in a controlled, auditable and user-focused manner, suitable for public-sector and regulated environments.

---

## Scope and Objectives

The objectives of this security baseline are to:

- Reduce the risk of unauthorised access and account compromise
- Protect users from common email-based threats
- Improve endpoint security and malware protection
- Ensure accountability through audit logging and governance
- Support Cyber Essentials readiness and audit preparation

All configurations are documented using lab environments and best-practice guidance. No production data, credentials or tenant identifiers are included.
